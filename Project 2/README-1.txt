	For this project, I implemented the basic requirements of project. This program asks the user to enter several values for variables a-f, and calculates the solutions for Cramer’s rule. If the values entered do not have a solution, a method from the LinearEquation class is called and displays a message stating the set of variables does not have a solution. The Test class sets a variable error equal to the return value of isSolvable method and if the return value is false, the error message is displayed and the program terminates. 
	The project overall was very simple and the only issue I faced was at the very end when I would enter values that did not have a solution, the main function would display NaN. After a couple minutes of research, I realized that all I had to do was implement a Boolean variable in the main function and set that value equal to the value that isSolvable returns. If isSolvable returned false, the “error” message would be displayed. I also implemented an if statement, that if the Boolean variable was equal to false, the program would terminate. This got rid of the NaN output, which was displayed when the output lines for x and y were executed.
