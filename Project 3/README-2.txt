	The type of relationship between WumpusWorld and Square is aggregation. The WumpusWorld class is made up of the Square class. The multiplicity between the two is that WumpusWorld can have 16 squares, however, the Square class only makes up one WumpusWorld. The WumpusWorld class takes in a 2D array of squares in order to create the world.
	For this project, I implemented an ArrayList and used shuffle from the Collection class. I had a lot of trouble initializing the 2D array to the corresponding items (gold, Wumpus, etc.). After studying the textbook, and watching several YouTube videos, I found it easier to just use an ArrayList since I was using coordinates for the grid rather than numbering them off 1-16. This also made it easier to randomize the locations of the pits and Wumpus, and with the game itself (moving the human to another location). Another trouble that I had was with terminology. I was still quite unsure of the differences between, objects, instances, etc. However, after studying the slides and the textbook, I am now clearly able to differentiate them. Also, with the help of you, I realized that I wasn’t creating 16 squares, I only had created a reference but never did anything with them.  
	Another main issue I had was propagating the stenches and breezes around the Wumpus and the pits. This was what made me look up another alternative to regular arrays, and you mentioned ArrayLists during class and after researching them, I realized that this was much easier implementation for me at least. I was getting frustrated that the stenches and breezes were not displaying, so I added a toString method to concatenate the corresponding characters together.
